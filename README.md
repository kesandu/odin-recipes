# odin-recipes

This project is a basic recipe website comprising 3 delightful (and rather tasty) recipes.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the foundational HTML skills required to build web pages (credit: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)).

The basic HTML constructs exhibited are:

* Document structure
* Elements
* Tags
* Text
* Lists
* Images
* Links

The project is published on GitHub Pages.
